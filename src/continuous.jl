"""
    plotabm(model::ABM{A, <: ContinuousSpace}; ac, as, am, kwargs...)
Plot all agents of the `model` on continuous space by (optionally)
configuring how to plot the agents with keywords `ac, as, am`.

`ac` = agent color, `as` = agent size, `am` = agent marker shape.

These arguments can be constants (numbers, strings, etc.), and then all agents
get the same property. Or, they can be **functions**, that take as input the
list of agents, and output a vector of colors, sizes, or shapes
(anything acceptable by `scatter`).

Defaults: `ac = "#765db4", as = 8, am = :o`. All other keywords are
propatted into `Plots.scatter`.
